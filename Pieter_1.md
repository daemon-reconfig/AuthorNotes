An open letter To Sasha and my friends in St Petersburg:

I'm sorry it has been so long since I've been in touch.
A lot has been happening here, which I will begin to explain in this letter.
I was not able to write before for reasons that are probably obvious to you now.
Now that the stars have realigned in St Petersbug
I don't have a way of contacting you more directly.
I hope this letter finds its way to you.

At the risk of telling you much that you already know,
Dmitri was sent to us early last year to take the reins due to
what was perceived as our refusal to act in alignment with Alexei's
instructions.
Now that Alexei is no longer a factor, I can explain
what happened to Dmitri.
Dmitri arrived and in short order assessed the power dynamic here in
Portland, and decided that we should not be so subservient to Cindy's interests.
I don't think he understood our relationship with her and how it was
in the best interest of all concerned.
I tried to explain to him that,
as the saying goes, one does not piss into the wind.
But Dmitri demanded that
we begin formulating a plan to ensure Cindy is subservient.

About that time Takahide arrived in town and asked for my help with a contract
he had from Tokyo to take Dmitri out of the picture.
As you might imagine this offered both a problem and an opportunity.

I should give a little more background to help make my position clear.
Several years ago I took a business meeting in Cindy's gentleman's club,
The Frog And Toad, which is a place for delightful entertainment and one
of my favorite places for conducting business.
On that particular day there was a new girl working, Nancy, and she and I
got along quite well.
We met outside the club later, and eventually had a child together.
My point in this regression is that things have changed for me, and
I no longer wish to take unnecessary risks in business.
Both Nancy and I have good relations with Cindy, and we wish it to remain so.

So, when Takahide arrived it seemed to offer a way out of my dilemma with Dmitri.
With Nancy as an intermediary, Cindy suggested a particular date for the operation
that Dmitri wanted to undertake against her.
Cindy also passed to me, through Nancy, an ammo clip that she asked us to
place in Dmitri's gun before our arrival.

You've probably already read about what happened from Wendy's account (https://t.me/ask_wendy_anything/152),
from the police report, and from the security footage.
I might be able to fill in a couple of gaps.

After we drove the armored vehicle through the wall of Cindy's warehouse where planned,
and Dmitry demanded the money and Marijuana crop,
Cindy came to talk to us.
The room we were in was an active grow room.
I was surprised to see Takahide already there, along with Wendy and Trish,
all of whom quickly took refuge behind a steel table.
Cindy was calm, approached us and quietly told us (in Russian) that she was
delighted that we were interested, but she was sorry for the
inconvenience and that she would not be able to help us.
Then she told us that if we would just leave quietly there would be
no hard feelings and we would be free to go without any incident.
Unfortunately, as we were leaving, she quietly made an insulting remark
to Dmitry, telling him to "run along home".

We took Dmitry with us out of the warehouse, but he insisted on returning and
confronting Cindy. We let him do so alone, with his gun containing the
ammunition Cindy had provided. I think you know what happened after that (https://t.me/ask_wendy_anything/191).

Takahide provided us with a gold ingot to pass on to Cindy as payment for her services,
and we spent the next couple of days rebuilding the warehouse wall.
Being in the middle between Alexei and the Yakuda has been quite uncomfortable
for me, but I can assure you that it is now quite safe to travel to Portland now.

Please wish your mother my best.

Yours,
Pieter
